**Overview**

In 1986, Craig Reynolds created a realistic-looking simulation of the
flocking behavior of birds called the Boids model. One remarkable thing
about the Boids model (named after the stereotypical New Yorkerâ€™s pronunciation of the word birds) 
is that only three simple rules govern the interaction between individuals in the flock, 
yet the model produces behavior similar to that of a real flock. 
The Boids model is widely studied and has even been used to animate computer-generated swarms like the marching
penguins in the movie Batman Returns (1992).


**Usage**

`git clone`

`cd n-body-simulation`

`python flock.py`


The script is written in Python3.8.
